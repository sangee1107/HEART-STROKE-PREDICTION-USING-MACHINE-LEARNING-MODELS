# HEART-STROKE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-MODELS
Health care field has a huge amount of data. To deal with those dataâ€™s many techniques are used. Someone, somewhere in the world, suffers from a stroke. When someone experiences a stroke, quick medical care is critical. Heart stroke is the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart stroke is similar to heart attack which affects the blood vessels of the heart. Different features can be used to predict the heart stroke.In order to predict the  heart stroke an Effective heart stroke prediction system (EHSPS)is developed using machine learning algorithms. The data set used are classified in terms of 12 parameters like hypertension, heart disease, bmi, smoking status etc. These are the inputs for machine learning algorithms which are used to  predict the heart stroke. The project aims to build a Machine learning model which predicts the heart stroke.
